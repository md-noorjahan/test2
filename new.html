                            Automatic Sanitation of Public Toilets
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Designed an automated sanitizer sprayer for public toilets using Arduino UNO, a servo motor, and a DC 
water pump, ensuring contactless sanitation. Integrated LED/buzzer for process indication. System 
operates without human intervention to maintain hygiene.

                           Water Level Indicator using IC 555  timer
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Developed a water level alarm system using a DC supply, resistors, capacitors, IC 555 timer, probes, and 
                a buzzer. The system remains silent when water is below capacity and activates the buzzer once full. 
                Ensures efficient water monitoring.

                        Raspberry PI based semi-autonomous rover for pre-defined navigation path
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In this research, we design and build a semi-autonomous rover which employs the A* 
navigating algorithm to navigate from a source to a destination in a grid-based system.The rover can modify its course in real time to prevent obstacles
